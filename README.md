Hello!

Thank you for taking the time to check out our first baby,
this flutter app that Kat and I (Nathalia) built up in about 24 hours for
AthenaHacks 2021 with absolutely no previous knowledge whatsoever with Dart
or Flutter (or any other language really, but that's another can of worms).

The name of this app is Bon Voyage and its purpose is harm reduction through
accurate and direct information. If someone took the decision of doing
any type of drug, they should not only be aware of the consequences of
their actions, but also have the information needed to navigate the
situation with minimum harm as possible.

We still have a lot of dreams and plans for this app and still plan to
continue it and add many things moreâ€”but it will be done without the time
constraints of a hackathon hahaha.

I hope you enjoy our not-the-most-beautiful but still very charming son!
